# Examples and implementations of service locator in react

https://github.com/mvcbox/node-service-locator2/blob/master/ServiceLocator.js
Simplistic and a bit naive implementation of service locator in node.js


https://github.com/rhyek/react-service-locator/tree/main
a more complex example that uses inversify under the hood


https://github.com/traviskaufman/react-service-container
This is an aproach that uses a container to store the services and a hook to access them. I like this approach because it is simple and easy to understand. It is also very flexible and can be used in any react project.
